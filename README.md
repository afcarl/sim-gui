This is Sim-gui, a GUI for generating FLAME simulations and post-simulation data processing.

VERSION HISTORY:

Sim-gui 1.0
(c) 2014 Philipp Harting

Features:
- This version is the original java code of Sim-gui.

Sim-gui 1.1
(c) 2014 Philipp Harting, 2015 Bohgdan Pukalskyi

Features:
- Version 1.1 is a refactoring of the original java code of Sim-gui.
- This version is template based. In Sim-gui 1.0 the java code and the code to generate the bash scripts were literally verbatim inside the java code. In this version all bash scripts are templates, cleanly separating the two code bases, which allows to adapt the template files without a need to change the java code of the GUI.
